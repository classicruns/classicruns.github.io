	<h2 class="text-center"> What is 1.16 classic? </h2>
        <img src="images/siteim2.png" alt="Classic Piglin Trading">
        <p>1.16 classic, also sometimes called “classic strats,” is the first strategy used extensively by Minecraft speedrunners to speedrun version 1.16. In a classic run, speedrunners will not use any resources from a bastion or monument. Instead, runners will typically trade with stray piglins using smaller amounts of gold, or kill endermen for their ender pearls.</p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="text-center"> Why play classic strats? </h2>
        <p> Classic is frowned upon by many players because of the less linear routes and how unlikely it is to get all the required resources compared to bastions. Still, there are many good reasons to play the strategy. Classic strats make it feasible for runners to overlap their piglin trades with killing blazes, potentially saving significant time in the nether. Additionally, if the runner gets lucky enough to apply blind travel or calculated travel in their classic run, then the strategy can be even faster, competing with the speeds of today’s bastion completion times. But ignoring the speed potential, classic is a unique way to change up your gameplay. The player must learn to remain mentally strong as the rng requirements are stricter. The player must also learn to adapt to varying environments. Finally, classic is a great way to revisit the past of Minecraft 1.16 speedrunning strategies. In short, here are some reasons to consider classic strats: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Potential to overlap piglin trades with blaze split</li>
        <li>Developing a tougher speedrunner mentality</li>
        <li>Learning to adapt to less consistent speedrun environments</li>
        <li>Revisiting the nostalgic past of Minecraft 1.16 speedrunning</li>
        </ul>
